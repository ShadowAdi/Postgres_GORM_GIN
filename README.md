# **Backend With Go**
### It is a CRUD Application in Golang.
You Can Not Only Perform Crud Operation  On Only Single Database.But There are two databases. `User` and `Books`
In This Project I Have Create A Backend of An Application With The Help of `Go` Language And I Also Integrated The `PostgreSQL` Database.
The Frameworks and Library I Use To Done This Project are-->

 * **Gin**. This Framework Is Used For Route Handling And Middlewares.
 * **GORM**. It is an ORM Library Used To Connect With Database With Postgres. You Can also use it to Connect to other Databases.

It Contains Two Databases One For   User and One for Books Both Databases are connected through each other through `Foreign Key`.
It Actually Work Like this That a person Can Create His Account And He also Gave A List Of Books. 
The Code Is Also  in Packages Form.So It Becomes easier For us To Understand.
I Followed `MVC` Pattern.
